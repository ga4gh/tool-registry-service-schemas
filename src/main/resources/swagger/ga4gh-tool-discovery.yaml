  title: GA4GH Tool Discovery API
  description: >-
    Proposed API for GA4GH (Global Alliance for Genomics & Health) tool
    repositories. A tool consists of a set of container images that are paired
    with a set of documents. Examples of documents include CWL (Common Workflow
    Language) or WDL (Workflow Description Language) or NFL (Nextflow) that
    describe how to use those images and a set of specifications for those
    images (examples are Dockerfiles or Singularity recipes) that describe how
    to reproduce those images in the future. We use the following terminology, a
    "container image" describes a container as stored at rest on a filesystem, a
    "tool" describes one of the triples as described above. In practice,
    examples of "tools" include CWL CommandLineTools, CWL Workflows, WDL
    workflows, and Nextflow workflows that reference containers in formats such
    as Docker or Singularity.
