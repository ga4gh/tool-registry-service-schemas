  title: GA4GH Tool Discovery API
  description: >-
    Proposed API for GA4GH (Global Alliance for Genomics & Health) tool
    repositories. A tool consists of a set of container images that are paired
    with a set of documents. Examples of documents include CWL (Common Workflow
    Language), WDL (Workflow Description Language), NFL (Nextflow), GXFORMAT2
    (Galaxy), or SMK (Snakemake) that describe how to use those images and a set
    of specifications for those images (examples are Dockerfiles or Singularity
    recipes) that describe how to reproduce those images in the future. We use
    the following terminology, a "container image" describes a container as
    stored at rest on a filesystem, a "tool" describes one of the triples as
    described above. In practice, examples of "tools" include CWL
    CommandLineTools, CWL Workflows, WDL workflows, and Nextflow workflows that
    reference containers in formats such as Docker or Singularity.
