## Instruction for modifying the TRS

To make changes to the TRS, join the GA4GH organization or ask to join this repository as a collaborator. Then in your branch, modify:
 - The openapi.yaml file with an OpenAPI 3 definition of the changes.
   - This openapi yaml file will be used in the TRS validation server.

The v1 and v2 directories should not be modified. They provide a historical record and potentially backward compatibility support for TRS servers/clients.
